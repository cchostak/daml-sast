# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security reports.

Preferred options:

1) Use GitHub Security Advisories (if enabled for this repository).
2) If you have an existing private channel with the maintainers, use that.
3) If neither is available, open a minimal issue requesting a private contact and share no sensitive details until a private channel is established.

Include the following in your report:

- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (or a proof-of-concept)
- Affected versions or commits, if known

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest development branch. Older releases may not receive backports.
